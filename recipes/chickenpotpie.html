    <h1>Cooking Steps</h1>
 <ol>
    <li>Prepare pastry crust ahead of time: In a large bowl, combine flours and salt; cut in butter with a pastry blender or fork until crumbly. Add water; stir until dough comes together. (You can also combine flours in a food processor. Add butter, and pulse until mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add water, and pulse until dough comes together.) Form dough into a ball; flatten into a disk. Wrap, and chill at least 1 hour or until ready to prepare pie.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Remove pastry crust from refrigerator, and let soften slightly while preparing filling.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, celery, carrots and green beans, then cook 3 minutes or until tender.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle flour over vegetables and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add broth, milk, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper, stirring until well blended. Cook 5 minutes or until thickened and bubbly. Stir in chicken, green beans, salt and pepper. Spoon mixture into a 9-inch pie dish.</li>
    <li>Roll pastry between two sheets of plastic wrap into a 9 1/2-inch circle. Lay crust on top of chicken mixture. Fold excess crust along edges, pressing down with a fork on edges to seal. Cut vents in top of crust.</li>
    <li>Place pie on a baking sheet, and put in oven; bake 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
